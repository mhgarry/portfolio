                        My name is Matthew Garry and this is my working web design portfolio. I am an aspiring full stack web designer who is currently going to a Rutgers University 
                        hosted full stack web diesign bootcamp. I've worked for years in the restuarant industry holding various jobs including expiediting and serving for the last 
                        ten years. This has taught me a number of invalubale skills including team work, organization, leadership, multi-tasking, sales, as well as working under extreme pressure. 
                        I'm an artist, a writer, and a student as well as a web designer. 
                        
                        I'm proficent in sturcturing a page with HTML-5, styling a page with CSS, adding features with the programming language JavaScript, Github for working with a team and creating organized
                        repositories showing my work, and integrating JSON into my development. I view web design as a collabortive process between every element involved in designing a website and I strive to make 
                        functional, fast, unique, beautiful, and intutive web applications that integrate scripting and styling together seamlessly. I'm currently able to use Jquery, Bootstrap, and Tailwind to enhance 
                        my projects both functionally and styilistically. I believe that this offers the best user experience. I pride myself on flexibility and my ability to work with a team as well as individually. 
                        I'm extremely comfortable using "Agile" software development. This portofolio is ever expanding as is my skillset in web design. 

                        Feel free to contact me using the links at the bottom of the page if you would like me to build your 
                        next website, join your team, or if you would like to work with me on your next project!

                        Below this paragraph (you will also be directed there by clicking the projects tab in the Navigation Bar at the top of the page) are some web applications I'd like to highlight that 
                        I've built either as a team or by myself. 

                        In particular I'd like to highlihgt my latest project I built as a coding bootcamp student with three of my classmates. This project is the MVP(Minimum Viable Proudct) of a web application using two APIs 
                        we had never used along with a new CSS framework. We called the application "MyDicitonary" and built it in three days with a strict deadline simulating the pressures of a real world work situation. We 
                        used "Agile" software developemnt to help us accomplish this task. 
                        
                        We split up our tasks according to our unique skillsets while keeping in communication with each other about overarching ideas, themes, and functionality of our Web Application. 
                        Personally I did the bulk of the styling for the website using Tailwind. I also created the website's logo in Adobe Illustrator. Along with this I laid out the framework for the website using 
                        HTML and wrote the alt-text for the website. I helped with the JavaScript and Jquery conceptually and finally integrated all the seperate elements of this application together and got it up and 
                        running as a funtional application. Please take a look at this project in the Projects section of this page.
